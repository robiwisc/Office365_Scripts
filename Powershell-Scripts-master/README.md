Over the past year or so I have been collecting simple powershell scripts that I find useful and often use on a regular basis.
These have all been tested and all have worked for me, however, if any do not work let me know and I'll see if I can work out whats gone wrong.
I am in no way an expert on Powershell and most of these I have found online and then simply altered to fit my own purposes. 
Feel free to use any and if you have any others that you think I am missing let me know! 
Once again, these are mostly very simple but get the job done for what I need to do!

I should add, some of these are set up to be used stand alone, whereas some are set up for you to be signed in and have loaded the O365 module to use them.
If this is the case simply look at the file named "1) PowerShell - NEW LOGIN .txt"

You can either access the files as .txt which are within the folder or simply use the .ps1 files which show the syntax.
